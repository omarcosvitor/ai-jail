# ai-jail — Development Guidelines

## What This Project Is

A Rust CLI tool that wraps an OS sandbox to run AI coding agents (Claude Code, GPT Codex, OpenCode, Crush): bubblewrap (`bwrap`) on Linux, `sandbox-exec` on macOS, and Microsoft's ProcessContainer (`wxc-exec`) on Windows. It replaces a bash script with config persistence (`.ai-jail` TOML), proper signal handling, and a developer-friendly CLI.

## Project Structure

```
src/
  main.rs         -- entry point, orchestration, TempFile RAII guard
  cli.rs          -- argument parsing with lexopt
  config.rs       -- .ai-jail TOML config load/save/merge (project + global)
  sandbox/
    mod.rs        -- shared sandbox logic, mount lists, launch wrapper
    bwrap.rs      -- bwrap command builder + mount discovery (Linux)
    landlock.rs   -- Landlock LSM path + network rules (Linux)
    seccomp.rs    -- seccomp-bpf syscall filter (Linux)
    rlimits.rs    -- resource limits (NPROC, NOFILE, CORE)
    seatbelt.rs   -- sandbox-exec SBPL profile generation (macOS)
    windows.rs    -- ProcessContainer policy handed to wxc-exec (Windows)
    rlimits_windows.rs -- limits are the MXC job object's job (Windows)
  pty.rs          -- PTY proxy with vt100 virtual terminal (raw mode, IO loop, diff rendering)
  pty_windows.rs  -- ConPTY proxy via portable-pty (Windows)
  terminal_filter.rs -- control-sequence filter for the ConPTY proxy (Windows)
  statusbar.rs    -- persistent terminal status bar overlay (redraw, update check)
  statusbar_windows.rs -- no status bar on Windows yet (stubs)
  signals.rs      -- signal forwarding + child process reaping
  signals_windows.rs -- console control events reach the child through ConPTY (stub)
  output.rs       -- colored terminal output helpers (raw ANSI, no deps)
  bootstrap.rs    -- AI tool config generation (Claude, Codex, OpenCode)
  command.rs      -- harness/ai-memory wrapper detection, effective command names
  fsutil.rs       -- atomic file writes (0600), symlink-safe target checks
  fsutil_windows.rs -- atomic writes locked down with icacls (Windows)
```

Platform-specific modules are wired in `main.rs` with `#[cfg]` plus `#[path]`, so
`pty`, `fsutil`, `signals`, and `statusbar` resolve to the Windows file on Windows
and to the Unix file everywhere else. The rest of the code never branches on the
platform.

## Critical Rule: Backward Compatibility

**Every new version MUST work with previously generated `.ai-jail` config files.**

This is the single most important invariant of the project. Users generate `.ai-jail` files in their project directories and expect them to keep working after upgrading the binary.

### Config file rules

- **Never remove a config field.** If a field becomes obsolete, keep deserializing it but ignore its value. Use `#[serde(default)]` on all fields so missing fields get defaults.
- **Never rename a config field.** If a better name is needed, add the new name and keep the old one as an alias (`#[serde(alias = "old_name")]`).
- **Never change a field's type.** A `Vec<String>` must stay a `Vec<String>`. If richer types are needed, add a new field.
- **New fields must have defaults.** Always use `#[serde(default)]` so old config files without the field still parse.
- **Unknown fields must be silently ignored.** Never use `#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]`. This allows old configs with removed fields to still load.
- When writing config files, only serialize fields that differ from defaults (keeps files clean for users who edit them by hand).

### CLI option rules

- **Never remove a CLI flag.** If a flag becomes obsolete, keep accepting it silently (with an optional deprecation warning to stderr).
- **Never change the meaning of an existing flag.** `--no-gpu` must always mean "disable GPU passthrough".
- **New flags must not break existing invocations.** Defaults for new flags must preserve the prior behavior.
- **Positional command behavior is sacred.** `ai-jail claude` must always mean "run claude inside the sandbox".

### Security defaults and config authority

- Private home is on by default. Command-specific state may be supplied by
  global config; broad home exposure requires explicit `--no-private-home`.
- Network, GPU, display, X11, host shared memory, terminal passthrough, macOS
  host IPC, and worktree metadata are opt-in. Do not weaken these defaults.
- Project `.ai-jail` is untrusted monotonic policy. It may tighten the effective
  sandbox but cannot enable capabilities, outside maps, ports, `claude_dir`, or
  exceptions. Capability opt-ins belong in global config or on the CLI.
  The single exception is `trust_project_config` in the _global_ config, which
  names directories whose project files are merged with trusted semantics. The
  trust always originates in the trusted layer: a project file that sets
  `trust_project_config` itself is ignored and warned about.
- Existing malformed config, bootstrap/wrapper setup, and overlay setup must
  fail closed. Bootstrap files must remain mode `0600`.

### Testing backward compatibility

There are regression tests in `src/config.rs` that parse old config file formats. **When changing config.rs, always add a new regression test with the old format before making changes.** Never delete existing regression tests.

## Coding Conventions

- **No async, no tokio.** This is a synchronous CLI tool.
- **Minimal dependencies.** Current deps: `lexopt`, `serde`, `toml`, `serde_json`, `vt100`, `nix`, `landlock`, `seccompiler` (Linux), `portable-pty` and `windows-sys` (Windows). Do not add new crates without a strong justification.
- **No clap.** We use `lexopt` for argument parsing to keep the binary small.
- **Raw ANSI for colors.** No color crate — `output.rs` handles this with raw escape codes.
- **Warn and skip, never crash.** Missing paths, unreadable dirs, and non-critical errors produce a warning and continue. Existing `.ai-jail` files that cannot be read or parsed are fatal because silently dropping sandbox policy would fail open. Other fatal errors include no bwrap and an unavailable current directory.
- **Signal safety.** The signal handler (`signals.rs`) must only use async-signal-safe operations. The current handler just calls `libc::kill` on the stored child PID.
- **RAII for cleanup.** Temp files use a `Drop` guard, not manual cleanup.

## Mount Order Matters

The bwrap command mounts are order-dependent. The sequence in `sandbox/bwrap.rs` must be:

1. Base mounts (`/usr`, `/etc`, `/opt`, `/sys`, `/dev`, `/proc`, `/tmp`, `/run`)
2. Sensitive /sys masks (tmpfs over `/sys/firmware`, `/sys/kernel/security`, etc.)
3. GPU devices
4. Docker socket
5. Tailscale socket
6. Shared memory (`/dev/shm`)
7. Display mounts (validated Wayland socket and optional X11; never the whole runtime directory)
8. systemd user bus mounts (`--systemd-user`, narrow explicit runtime sockets)
9. Home directory (tmpfs `$HOME` first, then command-specific state/dotfiles)
10. Config hide (tmpfs over sensitive `~/.config/*` subdirs)
11. Cache hide (tmpfs over sensitive `~/.cache/*` subdirs)
12. Local overrides (`~/.local/state`, `~/.local/share/*` rw subdirs)
13. Command binary exemption (paths the sandbox would otherwise hide: under private home the command's own directory beneath `$HOME`, and always the NixOS system profile under the private `/run`)
14. Linked Git worktree metadata (validated, opt-in; common dir mounted first, then the nested per-worktree git dir — both writable outside lockdown, both read-only under it)
15. SSH agent socket and `~/.ssh` exemption mounts
16. Pictures mount
17. Browser profile state mount
18. Extra user mounts (`--map`, `--rw-map`)
19. Overlay maps (`--overlay-map` — copy-on-write `--overlay-src`/`--overlay`)
20. Project directory (pwd, rw or ro depending on mode)
21. In-project user mounts (after the project bind)
22. In-project overlay maps (after the project bind)
23. Mask overlays (`--mask` and hidden project `.ai-jail`)
24. Deny overlays (`--deny-path`, mode-000 file/dir placeholders)
25. Overlay storage hide (tmpfs over `<project>/.ai-jail-overlays`, last)

Changing this order can break the sandbox. The tmpfs for `$HOME` must come before the individual dotfile bind mounts. Overlay maps come after the home/dotfile mounts (so an overlay on a home path sits on top). User mounts and overlay maps whose destination sits **inside** the project directory are emitted after the project mount — bwrap gives the later mount precedence, so emitting them earlier lets the project bind silently shadow them (issue #83: `--map .git` stayed writable and in-project overlay writes hit the real files). Mask and deny overlays come after those so they still win. Overlay storage hide comes last, after the project mount, so it masks the upper/work layers the project mount would otherwise expose.

## Before Committing

Always run `cargo fmt` before committing. CI enforces `cargo fmt --check` and will fail on unformatted code. The project uses `max_width = 80` via `rustfmt.toml`.

```
cargo fmt
cargo clippy -- -D warnings
cargo test
```

## Running Tests

```
cargo test
```

Tests are in `#[cfg(test)]` modules at the bottom of each source file. Config tests use `tempfile`-style patterns with `std::env::temp_dir()`.

## Building

```
cargo build --release    # 881K stripped binary
```

Install by copying `target/release/ai-jail` to `~/.local/bin/` or `/usr/local/bin/`.
