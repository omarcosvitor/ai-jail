# Security model

ai-jail is a process sandbox for AI tools, not a malware-analysis boundary.
It limits ordinary filesystem, namespace, and IPC exposure; a kernel, driver,
or sandbox escape is outside its boundary. Use a disposable VM for truly
hostile workloads.

## Defaults and explicit capabilities

`--display` does not imply X11: X11 needs `--x11`. `--browser` reuses an
isolated profile but still requires explicit `--network` and, on Linux,
`--display` (or `--x11`) to reach anything; on macOS the display is
system-level, so only `--network` applies there. Systemd user integration
uses explicit narrow sockets only. Docker requires `DOCKER_HOST` to name an
actual Unix socket; network endpoints are not mounted, and `~/.docker` is not
broadly mounted. Kimi and other agent state is command-specific under private
home.

`--allow-tcp-port` is accepted for compatibility but launch fails closed. UDP
cannot be securely constrained by that interface. Use `--network` if the
resulting unrestricted network access is explicitly intended.

## Configuration trust boundary

Project `.ai-jail` is untrusted input. Its policy is monotonic: it can tighten
the effective sandbox but cannot enable capabilities, outside-source or
outside-destination maps, ports, `claude_dir`, or policy exceptions. Put
capability opt-ins in `~/.ai-jail` command-specific tables or on the CLI.

Teams that ship per-repository policy can opt specific directories out of that
rule from the trusted global config:

```toml
# ~/.ai-jail
trust_project_config = ["~/work/repos"]
```

A project at or beneath a listed directory is merged with the same semantics
as a global `[commands.<name>]` table, so its `.ai-jail` may enable
capabilities. Both paths are resolved before comparison, so `..` segments and
symlinks cannot smuggle an unlisted project past the check, and a project that
sets `trust_project_config` itself is ignored — trust is only ever conferred by
the global config. Everything under a listed directory is trusted, including
repositories cloned there later, so keep the list narrow.
Existing unreadable or invalid config fails closed. Bootstrap output is mode
`0600`; launch wrappers and overlay setup also fail closed.

The project `.ai-jail` is never followed through a symlink. The global
`~/.ai-jail` may be one, so dotfile managers such as GNU stow work, but only
when the resolved target is a regular file this user owns, carries no group or
other write bits, and lies outside the project directory — a target inside the
project could be rewritten by the very agent the policy constrains.

Private home is on by default. ai-jail exposes only state needed by the invoked
agent, and agent credential state itself is opt-in (`--agent-state`, also
settable per command in `~/.ai-jail`). Use
`--no-private-home` only as an explicit broad host-home exception.

## Platform notes and residual risks

Linux combines bubblewrap namespaces with Landlock, seccomp, and resource
limits where available. Seccomp denies raw and packet sockets, with one
narrow exception: `socket(AF_NETLINK, SOCK_RAW, NETLINK_ROUTE)`, which
`getifaddrs()` uses to enumerate local interfaces, is permitted when the
sandbox already has unrestricted network and is not in lockdown. Blocking it
there bought nothing — an agent with `--network` can learn the same addresses
by connecting out — while breaking any tool that calls `getifaddrs()`. Every
other netlink protocol and every other raw socket domain stays denied, and
under `--lockdown` or without `--network` so does this one, so lockdown's
`/sys/class/net` mask cannot be walked around. `BWRAP_BIN` must resolve canonically either to a
root-owned executable with no group- or world-write bits, or to an executable
with no write bits at all under a `/nix/store` that is itself owned by root
(or by an unmapped owner, which a user namespace reports as the overflow uid)
and is not world-writable. A single-user store owned by the invoking user does
not qualify: anything running as them could otherwise supply a fake bwrap and
silently disable the sandbox.

The store check deliberately stops at ownership and mode rather than asking
the kernel whether this process can write the directory. The standard
multi-user store is `root:nixbld` mode `1775`, and Nix builds run as a nixbld
member, so a writability probe answers "yes" for exactly the legitimate case
and rejects every such install. The sticky bit is what makes that group write
safe — a member can add store paths but not replace someone else's — so it is
required rather than assumed: a group-writable store without it is refused.
The binary itself must still carry no write bits.

macOS starts with no global reads, network, or host IPC, and supports the same
opt-in `--agent-state` credential mounts as Linux. Temp access is limited to a
private per-launch session directory pointed to by `TMPDIR`, with one
command-specific exception: `claude` is also granted write access to
`/private/tmp/claude-<uid>`, scoped to the invoking uid, because Claude Code
creates that path unconditionally at startup and ignores `TMPDIR`. It is
outside the project and persists between runs; `--overlay-map` is honored
as a read-only map because copy-on-write overlays are Linux-only.
`sandbox-exec` is deprecated by Apple and is not equivalent to Linux
isolation; use a disposable VM for hostile workloads. Agents need `file-ioctl`
on their own terminal to enter raw mode, and SBPL cannot filter by ioctl
request, so the grant is scoped by path to the single PTY ai-jail allocated
for that run — never a pattern covering every `/dev/ttys*`, which would let a
compromised agent use `TIOCSTI` to inject input into another of your shells.
When ai-jail is not proxying a PTY, no terminal ioctl is granted at all.
`/dev/ptmx` stays available so the sandbox can allocate its own PTYs; a PTY
created inside the sandbox is not covered by the path-scoped rule. Linux
denies `TIOCSTI` outright through seccomp.

The macOS profile also grants `file-read-metadata` on each directory above an
allowed path, and on the symlink nodes leading to the command. Seatbelt
resolves a path one component at a time, so without this an allowed leaf stays
unreachable through the path callers actually walk. The grant is `stat()` of
those directory nodes only: it does not make them listable and does not reach
anything inside them, so it exposes the existence, mode and mtime of
directories the profile already grants access underneath — for a default run,
the chain down to the project and to the agent's own install. It is deliberately
narrower than a blanket `(allow file-read-metadata (subpath "/"))`, which would
also override the profile's own deny-list and let `stat` answer for `~/.ssh`
and `~/.aws`.

Naming the command's PATH entry matters for containment, not only for startup:
when that node is invisible, `execvp` does not fail, it continues down `PATH`
and runs the first match inside an already-readable prefix such as the Homebrew
one — a different build of the same tool than the one ai-jail resolved and
granted access to.

Windows runs the command inside a Microsoft ProcessContainer through
`wxc-exec` from the MXC SDK. ai-jail probes the host first and refuses to
launch when the probe reports no tier, `unsupported`, or `unavailable`, so a
machine without ProcessContainer never silently degrades into an unsandboxed
process. The policy handed to `wxc-exec` makes the project read-write
(read-only under `--lockdown`), everything else the agent needs read-only, and
under private home denies every entry of the user profile explicitly: the
container grants traversal through the project's ancestors, so without those
denials the profile's sibling files stay reachable. Loaded registry hives
(`NTUSER.DAT*`) are skipped there because a deny rule on a file Windows
already holds open fails the entire launch. Network egress, ingress, and host
loopback are denied together unless `--network` is set outside lockdown.
Resource limits belong to the MXC job object, not to ai-jail. The policy sets
`fallback.allowDaclMutation`, so the backend may rewrite DACLs on the paths it
was granted, acting as the invoking user; a run killed at the wrong moment can
leave those changes behind. Docker, Tailscale, and SSH-agent passthrough have
no pipe equivalent and are refused with a warning — `--ssh` exposes `~/.ssh`
read-only instead, `--overlay-map` degrades to a read-only map because
copy-on-write overlays are Linux-only, and alternate map destinations
(`--map src:dst`) are rejected outright. A symlinked global `~/.ai-jail` is
never trusted on Windows: the owner and write-bit checks that make a symlinked
config safe on Unix have no equivalent here. ProcessContainer is a containment
primitive of the running kernel, not a VM; use a disposable VM or WSL2 for
hostile workloads.

On every supported platform, kernel and driver bugs, terminal emulator bugs
(especially after terminal passthrough), and sandbox backend defects remain
residual risk.
